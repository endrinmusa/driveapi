This project helps you download all your Google Drive to your PC using Google API's capabilities. 
It scans the files on Google Drive, and based on their type it converts them as follows:

- Google Docs   -> Word (.docx)
- Google Sheets -> Excel (.xlsx)

Otherwise, it will just download the file on the format it was uploaded (ex. Archives).
